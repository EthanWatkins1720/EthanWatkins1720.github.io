						<img class="main-image" src="assignments/assignment1/japan.png">
						<p>Create a basic HTML page layout on a topic of your choice. This page 
							is about my trip to Japan. Elements used are of the most basic variety
							such as the title tag, h1, p, a bulleted list, and a small table. This 
							assignment laid the very bottom groundwork for what followed without proper
							use of flexboxes.</p>

						<a href="assignments/assignment2/index.html"><p>Assignment 2 - Basic CSS</p></a>
						<img class="main-image" src="assignments/assignment2/pirate.png">
						<p>Add more style to your site and create a cohesive theme that will be used across
							the site. This assignment page was based on pirates because I found the pirate ipsum
							generator amusing. Many of the page elements are the same as the first but with a little
							more consideration put into style, format, and technical application.</p>

						<img class="main-image" src="assignments/assignment3/flexbox.png">
						<p>Recreate a template laid out using more advanced techniques. With a focus on the use of 
							flexboxes, id's, classes, headers, and footers, the template is recreated here with minor 
							style choices to keep it in line with the rest of the site. The use of flexboxes 
							allows for more varied and unique layouts compared to a regular HTML layout.</p>

						<p>This assignment had us create a burger menu that appeared only on lower resolution
							screens. This menu would toggle the main nav menu. This, along with the exercises
							present on the page, introduced JS if statements.

						<p>This assignment had us use loops to create a running man who moves from the left to
							the right using an expanding margin. We also created an improved version of the
							thermometer from the previous assignment.

						<p>This assignment had us use arrays to store a selection of quotes to be displayed advanced
							colors to make a rainbow. In the end, a pot of gold will appear over the rainbow as well.
							The timeout function was also used to make the rainbow appear slowly.
