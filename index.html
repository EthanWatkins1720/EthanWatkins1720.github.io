						<p>Assignment 1 - Basic HTML</p>
						<img class="main-image" src="assignments/assignment1/japan.png">
						<p>Create a basic HTML page layout on a topic of your choice. This page 
							is about my trip to Japan. Elements used are of the most basic variety
							such as the title tag, h1, p, a bulleted list, and a small table. This 
							assignment laid the very bottom groundwork for what followed.</p>

						<p>Assignment 2 - Basic CSS</p>
						<img class="main-image" src="assignments/assignment2/pirate.png">
						<p>Add more style to your site and create a cohesive theme that will be used across
							the site. This assignment page was based on pirates because I found the pirate ipsum
							generator amusing. Many of the page elements are the same as the first but with a little
							more consideration put into style, format, and technical application.</p>

						<p>Assignment 3 - Page Layout</p>
						<img class="main-image" src="assignments/assignment3/flexbox.png">
						<p>Recreate a template laid out using more advanced techniques. With a focus on the use of 
							flexboxes, id's, classes, headers, and footers, the template is recreated here with minor 
							style choices to keep it in line with the rest of the site.</p>

						<p>Assignment 5 - Recreate CSS Page</p>
						<img class="main-image" src="https://place-hold.it/300x150/E8A27B">
						<p>Recreate a simplified version of a university website, excluding JavaScript elements. 
							This page will mimic the layout of the university page using flexboxes to recreate the 
							unique shapes and layout of the page.</p>
