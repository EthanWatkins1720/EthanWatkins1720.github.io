		<h1>Shinjuku</h1>
		<p>When I visited Japan myself, after a very late landing in 
            Haneda Airport in Tokyo, this was the first city I visited!
            I stayed a small hotel called Shin Okubo Sekitei. I was attracted to it 
            thanks to its reasonable rates, good reviews, and traditional Japanese style rooms.</p>

    <p>Shinjuku itself was very interesting containing everything from small neighborhoods
            to Asia's largest redlight district. I skirted the latter of these, named Kabukicho
            and it's probably best that I did. It can be a dangerous area! But while I was there,
            I did see a massive statue of Godzilla peaking out over a building! </p>
